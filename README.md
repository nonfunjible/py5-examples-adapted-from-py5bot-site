# py5-examples-adapted-from-py5bot-site

This repo is for py5 code adapted from the py5bot website at https://py5coding.org/tutorials/introduction_to_py5bot.html.

The code on that webpage requires the py5bot Jupyter kernel to run.

Here, the code examples have been modified to py5's "Module Mode" so that they can be run without the py5bot Jupyter kernel.
