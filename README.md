# py5 Examples Adapted from py5bot Site

[py5](https://github.com/py5coding) is a Python 3.8+ version of [Processing](https://github.com/processing), a platform for visual art.

This repo is for py5 code adapted from the [py5bot website](https://py5coding.org/tutorials/introduction_to_py5bot.html). The code on that webpage requires the py5bot Jupyter kernel to run. Here, the code examples have been modified to py5's **Module Mode** so that they can be run *without* the need for the py5bot Jupyter kernel.

## Examples

The 1st code example in this repo produces this:

![white square on yellow background](https://py5coding.org/_images/introduction_to_py5bot_1_0.png)

The 2nd code example in this repo produces a random iteration of this:

![randomly positioned and randomly colored squares](https://py5coding.org/_images/introduction_to_py5bot_5_0.png)

The 3rd code example in this repo shows that you can include a print() statement and produces this:

![red square](https://py5coding.org/_images/introduction_to_py5bot_7_1.png)

The 4th code example in this repo produces a random iteration of this:

![randomly positioned and randomly sized circles](https://py5coding.org/_images/introduction_to_py5bot_9_0.png)
